A quick way to access the Table~\ref{function_values:spring_problem} is
shown on Figure~\ref{fig:spring_tension_design_boxplot}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

It shows the same information as the Table~\ref{function_values:spring_problem}
and it evidences that not all algorithms have the same mean, so it is a clear evidence
that not all algorithm give similar results from an arbitrary starting point (population).
