Figure~\ref{fig:spring_problem_convergence} shows the
function maximum, minimum and mean function of algorithm's evolution:

EP, ES and FFA have the best fitness.
All algorithms seems to converge the minimum line very quickly when
the algorithm find a minimal point.
Apart from EP and ES, the algorithms seems to maintain exploration and exploitation
until the time runs out.
